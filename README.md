## Introduction

Data Structures and Algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science and play a crucial role in writing efficient and optimized code. The purpose of this repository is to help you strengthen your problem-solving skills and become more comfortable with different data structures and algorithmic techniques.

## Getting Started

To get started with your daily DSA practice, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   git clone https://github.com/your-chavda-mitul/dsa-practice.git

2. Navigate to the cloned repository:
   cd dsa-practice

3. Each day, you will find a new question in the repository. Solve the question using your preferred programming language and save your solution in a separate file.

4. After solving the question, you can add your solution file to the repository using the following commands:
   git add solution.cpp

5. Commit your changes with a descriptive message:
   git commit -m "Add solution for Day X"

6. Push your changes to the remote repository:
   git push

7. Repeat this process every day to practice a new question and track your progress.

## Question Format

Each day, you will find a new folder named "Day-X" (where X represents the day number). Inside each folder, you will find the following files:

- `README.md`: Contains the problem statement for the day's question, along with any additional information or constraints.
- `example.py`: Provides an example solution to the problem for reference.
- `solution.py`: This is where you should write your own solution to the problem.

Feel free to explore the provided example solution before attempting the question. However, it is recommended to solve the problem on your own first before referring to the example solution.
