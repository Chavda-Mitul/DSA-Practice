## Characteristics of Greedy algorithm

# For a problem to be solved using the Greedy approach, it must follow a few major characteristics:

1 There is an ordered list of resources(profit, cost, value, etc.)
2 Maximum of all the resources(max profit, max value, etc.) are taken.
For example, in the fractional knapsack problem, the maximum value/weight is taken first according to available capacit
Scheduling and Resource Allocation: The greedy algorithm can be used to schedule jobs or allocate resources in an efficient manner.

All greedy algorithms follow a basic structure:
1 Declare an empty result = 0.
2 We make a greedy choice to select, If the choice is feasible add it to the final result.
3 return the result.
